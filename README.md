# Renovate [shareable config](https://renovatebot.com/docs/config-presets/) for [SweetAlert2](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2)

## Usage

Enable Renovate in your repo and just `extends` in `renovate.json`.

```js
{
  "extends": ["github>sweetalert2/renovate-config"]
  // Additional, per-project rules...
}
```

Note: You don't have to install this config. Renovate fetches it from this GitHub repo automatically.

## TODO

- rollup minor and patch updates on a weekly basis https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/4404
